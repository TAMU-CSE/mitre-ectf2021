//! A near-exact port of the [original C implementation of interface](https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2021-ectf-insecure-example/blob/master/controller/interface.c),
//! but with some better typing to make the interface a little more ergonomic to use
//!
//! This interface is written as a result of some investigation of the original [`lm3s_cmsis.h`](https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2021-ectf-insecure-example/blob/master/controller/lm3s/lm3s_cmsis.h)
//! implementation, where some amount of code review was used to extract the [UART{0,1,2} addresses](https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2021-ectf-insecure-example/blob/master/controller/lm3s/lm3s_cmsis.h#L876)
//! (later confirmed by reviewing the [original specification](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3s6965.pdf))
//! as well as the [struct defining the UART peripheral](https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/2021-ectf-insecure-example/blob/master/controller/lm3s/lm3s_cmsis.h#L620).
//! The addresses for the memory-mapped UART peripherals were stored in the [INTF](INTF) enum and
//! these addresses were upcasted to mutable [UART](UART) references for use internally. Further
//! details, including the research that went into defining each type, can be found in their
//! respective type documentation.
//!
//! It was unnecessary to provide the device vector table or interrupt bindings as these are
//! helpfully defined for us by the [lm3s6965 crate](https://github.com/japaric/lm3s6965/blob/master/src/lib.rs)
//! (thanks, [Jorge Aparicio](https://github.com/japaric)!).
